	used for photon counting experiments and measurements of low intensity
	light sources, and are extensively employed in biological fluorescence
	imaging applications. These devices have a complex statistical behaviour
	that is often not fully considered in the analysis of EMCCD data.
	Robust and optimal analysis of EMCCD images requires an understanding
	of their noise properties, in particular to exploit fully the advantages
	of Bayesian and maximum-likelihood analysis techniques, whose value
	is increasingly recognised in biological imaging for obtaining robust
	quantitative measurements from challenging data. To improve our own
	EMCCD analysis and as an effort to aid that of the wider bioimaging
	community, we present, explain and discuss a detailed physical model
	for EMCCD noise properties, giving a likelihood function for image
	counts in each pixel for a given incident intensity, and we explain
	how to measure the parameters for this model from various calibration
	images.},

  abstract = {The recent development of diffraction-unlimited far-field fluorescence
	microscopy has overcome the classical resolution limit of \~{}250
	nm of conventional light microscopy by about a factor of ten. The
	improved resolution, however, reveals not only biological structures
	at an unprecedented resolution, but is also susceptible to sample
	drift on a much finer scale than previously relevant. Without correction,
	sample drift leads to smeared images with decreased resolution, and
	in the worst case to misinterpretation of the imaged structures.
	This poses a problem especially for techniques such as Fluorescence
	Photoactivation Localization Microscopy (FPALM/PALM) or Stochastic
	Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM), which often require minutes
	recording time. Here we discuss an approach that corrects for three-dimensional
	(3D) drift in images of fixed samples without the requirement for
	fiduciary markers or instrument modifications. Drift is determined
	by calculating the spatial cross-correlation function between subsets
	of localized particles imaged at different times. Correction down
	to \~{}5 nm precision is achieved despite the fact that different
	molecules are imaged in each frame. We demonstrate the performance
	of our drift correction algorithm with different simulated structures
	and analyze its dependence on particle density and localization precision.
	By imaging mitochondria with Biplane FPALM we show our algorithm's
	feasibility in a practical application.},

	spots, calculated with all effects of high numerical aperture, interfaces
	between media, polarization, dipole orientation and aberrations taken

	Estimator. For freely rotating dipole emitters it is found that the
	gaussian works fine. The same, theoretically optimum, localization
	accuracy is found as if the true PSF were a gaussian, even for aberrations
	within the usual tolerance limit of high-end optical imaging systems
	such as microscopes (Marechal's diffraction limit). For emitters
	with a fixed dipole orientation this is not the case. Localization
	errors are found that reach up to 40 nm for typical system parameters
	and aberration levels at the diffraction limit. These are systematic
	errors that are independent of the total photon count in the image.
	The gaussian function is therefore inappropriate, and more sophisticated
