    <h1>Duplicates Filter</h1>

    If two or more molecules are close to each other, it can happen that 
    the estimator converges to the same spot in between, thus, counting 
    the same false-positive detection twice. Similar situation can happen
    on the boundary of fitting region if two fitting regions overlap.
